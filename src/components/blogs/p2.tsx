      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mt-8 mb-4">Gameplay Overview</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        The game is designed with a 3D perspective, allowing players to move the board view. The board is made up of hexagons, which can be visualized as a “honeycomb” (some games that copied this refer to it as honeycomb elimination). These hexagonal grids dictate the fundamental rules of the game, as they create six distinct paths that interact with each other.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        The game offers six colors for the hexagonal pieces: red, black, white, blue, green, and yellow. These hexagons act as simple blocks of color. When two blocks of the same color, with adjacent sides touching, meet, one will transfer over to the other according to a priority sequence. When ten same-colored blocks are stacked on top of each other, they will be eliminated, and the player will earn around 20 points.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mt-8 mb-4">Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6 mb-3">Core Gameplay</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        In <strong class="text-blue-600 font-semibold">Hexa Sort</strong>, players sort hexagonal tiles by color and merge ten or more tiles of the same color to make them disappear from the board, clearing space for new tiles. Players continue stacking and clearing tiles while progressing through levels by meeting color goals.

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6 mb-3">Game Mechanics</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        The game combines two key mechanics: stacking and sorting. When players sort tiles, they automatically stack, creating a relaxing and satisfying experience as tiles merge and disappear from the board. The game provides both a strategic challenge and a calming experience.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6 mb-3">Level Design</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        The levels in Hexa Sort are well-balanced, with difficulty gradually increasing as players progress. Early levels teach players the basic mechanics, while later levels introduce more colors and new challenges, such as modified board shapes and updated goals.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mt-8 mb-4">Core Gameplay Flaws</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        So, what exactly is wrong with the core gameplay? Before answering this question, it’s important to briefly discuss the concept of “satisfaction” in games. Many might think that the feeling of satisfaction in elimination games comes from special effects, animations, and real-time feedback systems. But we should understand that these systems serve the core gameplay. If the core gameplay doesn't provide enough satisfaction, no matter how good the animation or special effects are, it can't compete with other games that provide instant satisfaction.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Satisfaction in elimination games is generated through the process of "elimination" or "sorting" and the results it brings. This is similar to the satisfaction viewers experience in videos where people pop pimples, clear weeds, or tidy up messy rooms. Most of the comments on these videos are about "stress relief." This connects to our human preference for an orderly and systematic world.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mt-8 mb-4">Gameplay Objective Issues</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        The game doesn’t clear the chaotic content from the board; rather, it adds new colored blocks to an already non-chaotic board, which are then stacked and eliminated for points to advance. This means players can’t enjoy the true sense of elimination. Instead, the board gets filled with more colors, and the game may end with no way out.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mt-8 mb-4">Monetization Problems</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        This flaw in gameplay has also led to serious issues with the game's monetization strategy. For instance, the frequent pop-up interstitial ads during level transitions are a common complaint in Google Play reviews. On iOS, there are even banner ads. The game's designers might want to rethink the design from a new perspective. For example, designing a game where players have to sort and eliminate blocks to empty the board, with the goal being to clear the board rather than score a specific number of points. This would align the game's core mechanics with its objectives, creating a more cohesive gameplay experience.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        In conclusion, <strong class="text-blue-600 font-semibold">Hexa Sort</strong> is an interesting hexagonal elimination game, but its core mechanics and game objectives need refinement. By changing the game’s goal to clearing the board and adding more strategy and balance, the game could provide a much more satisfying and enjoyable experience for players. The designers should consider these aspects in future updates to make the game more engaging and competitive in the market.
