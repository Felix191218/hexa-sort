      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mt-8 mb-4">About Hexa Sort</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <strong class="text-blue-600 font-semibold">Hexa Sort</strong> is a hybrid casual puzzle game published by Lion Studios in collaboration with 
        Mindstorm Studios and gamebra.in. Released on Android in July 2023 and on Apple in November 2023, the game quickly gained popularity, 
        reaching the top of the rankings by February 2024. It became the 9th most downloaded puzzle game and achieved its highest ranking 
        in the U.S. at third place in March (AppMagic). The game has also earned over $2 million in IAP revenue, thanks to a monetization 
        strategy that relies on ads rather than IAPs, with an ad-to-IAP revenue ratio of 70/30.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mt-8 mb-4">Hexa Sort: Gameplay Analysis</h2>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6 mb-3">Core Gameplay</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        In <strong class="text-blue-600 font-semibold">Hexa Sort</strong>, players sort hexagonal tiles by color and merge ten or more tiles of the same color 
        to make them disappear from the board, clearing space for new tiles. Players continue stacking and clearing tiles while 
        progressing through levels by meeting color goals.
      </p>

      />

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6 mb-3">Game Mechanics</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        The game combines two key mechanics: stacking and sorting. When players sort tiles, they automatically stack, creating a 
        relaxing and satisfying experience as tiles merge and disappear from the board. The game provides both a strategic challenge 
        and a calming experience.
      </p>
  
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6 mb-3">Level Design</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        The levels in Hexa Sort are well-balanced, with difficulty gradually increasing as players progress. Early levels teach players 
        the basic mechanics, while later levels introduce more colors and new challenges, such as modified board shapes and updated goals.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        A key monetization strategy in Hexa Sort is the strategic use of rewarded video ads, which allow players to unlock tiles 
        to continue progressing. This form of ad integration empowers players while offering a break from gameplay.
      </p>

        dynamic banner ads appear at the bottom of the screen without disrupting the experience.
      </p>

        strategies has proven effective in attracting new players.
